  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <h3>"What is the difference between 'switch' and 'if/else'? When would you use
one versus the other?"</h3>
  <p>
  </p>


  <h3>"What is the difference between a 'for', 'while' and 'do while' loop?
Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit
of a 'do while' loop over a 'while'?"</h3>
  <p>
  </p>

  <h3>"What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code?
Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in
‘java.util.Scanner;’?"</h3>
  <p>When you import you will be able to use items included with the import. There is way to many items under Java which arent always used. Therefore it makes it simplier to keep them seperate and import them when they are needed.
  </p>

  <h3>"What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ
from declaring a method with a return type?"</h3>
  <p> A 'void' declaration cannot have any return values. If you want a return value you must declare the method with variable type.
  </p>

  <h3>"When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an
“argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?"</h3>
