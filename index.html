  <h3>"What is the difference between 'switch' and 'if/else'? When would you use
one versus the other?"</h3>
  <p>
    if statements and switch statements are used to compare variables. switch is good when comparing the value to one variable and having a different result based on that value. if/else statements are good for multiple variables and running multiple tests.
  </p>


  <h3>"What is the difference between a 'for', 'while' and 'do while' loop?
Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit
of a 'do while' loop over a 'while'?"</h3>
  <p>
    for loops are used when you know how many times you want the loop to repeat, you set the value, the condition, and a counter at the beginning. a while loop will check the condition first and if it is true run the block of code and go back to the top to check the condition again. do while loops always run the section of code first and if the condition at the end is true the loop will run again. Do while loops are used when you don't have a value to check against the condition until the loop has ran.

  <h3>"What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code?
Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in
‘java.util.Scanner;’?"</h3>
  <p>
   Scanner is an optional library which can be used when imported. When you import a library you will be able to use items from the library. Not everything is included in the core java language because not everything is required for each program. I think the "java" is just the language or platform the Package is.
  </p>

  <h3>"What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ
from declaring a method with a return type?"</h3>
  <p>
    A 'void' declaration cannot have any return values. If you want a return value you must declare the method with variable type.
  </p>

  <h3>"When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an
“argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?"</h3>
  <p>
    Parameter is the variable delcared at the beginning of the function. Argument is when you call the function and you are giving the parameter a value.
